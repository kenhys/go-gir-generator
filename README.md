# Go-gir-generator

**Description**

Go-gir-generator imeplement static golang bindings for GObject.

There has many go bindings for GObject/Gtk libraries, but almost all of them
are written by hand. It's bored and error-prone when the binding C libaray changed.

Go-gir-geneator's object is like python-gobject's that binding the newest library
without need change binding codes.

Currently it only official support Gobject-2.0, Glib-2.0, Gio-2.0.
Because generate the gdkpixbuf binding hasn't completed, so Gdk/Gtk were
also in blocking.


Thanks the genius guys who created the
[Gobject Introspection](https://wiki.gnome.org/action/show/Projects/GObjectIntrospection)
and the orignal author [nsf](https://github.com/nsf/gogobject).
